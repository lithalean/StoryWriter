## Project Overview

**StoryWriter** is a focused markdown-based writing application for macOS/iOS that provides:
- Text editing with font controls (TextEditor currently)
- Advanced markdown system ready to integrate (97 MarkdownUI files)
- Character management interface (UI complete, no persistence)
- Index card system for story planning (UI complete, no persistence)
- Project organization with file browser (browse only, can't open files)

**Note**: Mapper functionality moved to separate StoryMapper application in January 2025

## Actual Component Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- **Writer Core** (40%): TextEditor, WriterDocument, WriterState, auto-save timer
- **Toolbar System** (100%): Perfect behavior-contract implementation
- **Project Manager** (100%): JSON save/load functional
- **Panel Navigation** (90%): 3-panel switching works perfectly

### üîÑ Partially Working
- **File Browser** (50%): Browse works, can't open files, 3 redundant implementations
- **Writer UI** (60%): Font controls, line numbers, word count all work
- **Panel Coordination** (40%): Panels work but limited data sharing

### üé® UI Complete (No Backend)
- **Character Sheet** (15%): Full UI, no data model
- **Index Cards** (10%): Static grid only
- **Timeline** (0%): Empty directory
- **Outline Panel** (0%): Placeholder in ContentView

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues
- **No Save UI**: Backend works but no button to trigger saves
- **Three File Browsers**: Confusing redundancy (FileSystem, FileBrowser, FileSystemModel)
- **Can't Open Files**: File browser doesn't connect to writer
- **No Undo/Redo**: Critical for any editor
- **Location Directory**: Still present (should be removed - mapper leftover)

## Active Development Areas

### Immediate Focus
1. **Integrate MarkdownUI** into Writer
2. **Consolidate File Browsers** to single implementation
3. **Add Save UI** trigger in toolbar
4. **Connect File Browser** to WriterDocument

### Next Phase
1. **Character Data Model** and persistence
2. **Index Card CRUD** operations
3. **Implement Undo/Redo**
4. **Export Functionality** (PDF, HTML, DOCX)

## Technical Debt Priority

### üî¥ Critical (Blocks Usage)
- No save UI trigger
- File browser can't open files
- Location/ directory present (oversight)

### üü° Major (Limits Features)
- Three file browser implementations
- MarkdownUI not integrated (97 files waiting)
- Character/Index no persistence
- No undo/redo system

### üü¢ Minor (Can Wait)
- Timeline directory empty
- Outline panel placeholder
- Platform inconsistencies

## Module Loading Priority

1. **Always load MANIFEST first** (this file - now updated)
2. **For writer work**: Load IMPLEMENTATION + MARKDOWNUI
3. **For architecture**: Load ARCHITECTURE + TOOLBAR (best examples)
4. **For history**: Load EVOLUTION (includes January 2025 refactor)
5. **For issues**: Load INTEGRATION yaml (known_issues section)

## Health Indicators

- ‚úÖ **Good**: Module is complete and current
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Active development in this module
- üé® **UI Only**: Visual complete, needs backend
- ‚è≥ **Ready**: Complete but waiting for integration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: Module needs immediate attention
- üìã **Active**: Specification/configuration in use

## Performance Metrics

- **Text Editing**: Native TextEditor performance
- **Panel Switching**: < 50ms
- **File Operations**: Synchronous (needs async)
- **Memory**: ~35MB baseline (reduced after mapper removal)
- **Bundle Size**: 163 files total, ~66 core + 97 MarkdownUI

## Time Investment

### Original Sprint (4-6 hours)
- Foundation + MarkdownUI import: 2 hours
- Writer + Mapper implementation: 3 hours
- UI polish: 1 hour

### January 2025 Refactor
- Separated StoryMapper: 16 files removed
- Added WriterDocument/WriterState: 2 files
- Documentation updates: In progress

### Estimated to Complete
- MarkdownUI integration: 1 day
- File browser consolidation: 1 day
- Character/Index persistence: 2 days
- Full feature complete: 5-7 days

## File Statistics

### Current State (Post-Refactor)
- **Total Files**: 163
- **Core Application**: ~66 files
- **MarkdownUI Library**: 97 files
- **Removed to StoryMapper**: 16 files

### By Component
- Writer: 7 files
- Character: 1 file
- Index: 2 files
- Project: 4 files
- Core: 3 files (should be 1)
- MarkdownUI: 97 files

## Next Steps

1. **Today's Priority**:
   - Integrate MarkdownUI
   - Consolidate file browsers
   - Add save button
   - Remove Location directory

2. **This Week**:
   - Character data model
   - Index card CRUD
   - Connect file browser to writer
   - Basic undo/redo

3. **Strategic**:
   - Consider MarkdownUI XCFramework
   - Plan export formats
   - Design preferences system

## Success Metrics

### Current Score: 4/10
- ‚úÖ Works: Text editing, font controls, panel navigation, project structure
- ‚ùå Doesn't: Save UI, file opening, markdown rendering, data persistence

### Target Score: 7/10
- MarkdownUI integrated
- All panels with persistence
- Single file browser working
- Save/load complete
- Export functional

### Version 1.0 Definition
- All panels functional with data models
- MarkdownUI rendering active
- Document save/load with UI
- Single file browser implementation
- Export to PDF/HTML minimum
