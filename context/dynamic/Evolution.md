**Project Created**: 8/26/24 by Tyler Allen  
**Development Time**: 4-6 hours (initial sprint)  
**Major Refactor**: January 2025 (StoryWriter/StoryMapper split)  
**Major Update**: September 2025 (Save system, UI consolidation)  
**Documentation Updated**: September 2025

## Project Timeline

### The Sprint (August 2024)
**Date**: 8/26/24  
**Duration**: 4-6 hours continuous coding  
**Context**: Rapid prototype development  
**Result**: 179 files including complete MarkdownUI library (97 files)

### January 2025 Refactor
**Change**: Separated into StoryWriter and StoryMapper  
**Impact**: 16 mapper files removed, WriterDocument/WriterState added  
**Result**: Cleaner focus, 163 files remaining

### September 2025 Update
**Duration**: ~2 days  
**Changes**: Save system complete, toolbar unified, Reader mode added  
**Impact**: Critical issues resolved, 168 files total  
**Result**: 60-65% complete (up from 40%)

## September 2025 Major Improvements

### What Was Fixed

#### Save System Crisis ✅
**Before**: Backend existed but no UI trigger  
**Solution**: Added save button to ProjectToolbar  
**Implementation**: Native dialogs, auto-save timer, dirty tracking  
**Result**: Complete save functionality

#### Toolbar Complexity ✅
**Before**: ProjectToolbar + WriterToolbar (confusing)  
**Solution**: Consolidated into single ProjectToolbar  
**Files Removed**: WriterToolbar.swift, WriterToolbarConfig.swift  
**Result**: Cleaner, unified navigation

#### File Browser Redundancy ✅
**Before**: Three implementations (FileSystem, FileBrowser, FileSystemModel)  
**Solution**: Single FileBrowser.swift implementation  
**Files Removed**: FileSystem.swift, FileSystemModel.swift  
**Result**: One clear implementation

#### Missing Statusbar ✅
**Before**: No information display  
**Solution**: ProjectStatusbar with behavior-contract  
**Features**: Word count, save status, settings menu  
**Result**: Complete information system

### What Was Added

#### Reader Mode
```
Reader/
├── ReaderWindow.swift    - Book-style reading view
└── ReaderState.swift     - Reading preferences
Status: Foundation complete (30%)
Purpose: Distraction-free reading experience
```

#### Formatter Panel
```
Formatter/
├── FormatterPanel.swift       - Right sidebar
└── FormatControlsView.swift   - Text controls
Status: Complete (100%)
Purpose: Replaced WriterToolbar font controls
```

#### Simplified Navigation
```
Before: 4+ panels (Writer, Character, Index, Mapper)
After: 2 modes (Writer, Reader)
Character/Index: Still exist but not in main navigation
```

## Major Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Single Window Architecture ✅
**Choice**: One window with switchable panels  
**Rationale**: Faster to implement, iOS compatibility  
**Result**: Works perfectly after simplification

### Decision 2: JSON Over SwiftData ✅
**Choice**: Use JSON files despite SwiftData setup  
**Rationale**: Quick prototype needs, familiar pattern  
**Result**: Simple and sufficient

### Decision 3: Import MarkdownUI Library ⏳
**Choice**: Include 97-file markdown system  
**Rationale**: Planned for rendering, future-proofing  
**Result**: Still not integrated but strategic asset

### Decision 4: Split Applications (January 2025) ✅
**Choice**: Separate StoryWriter and StoryMapper  
**Rationale**: Focus, maintainability, performance  
**Result**: Much cleaner architecture

### Decision 5: Unified Toolbar (September 2025) ✅
**Choice**: Merge WriterToolbar into ProjectToolbar  
**Rationale**: Reduce complexity, clearer UI  
**Result**: Significant simplification

### Decision 6: Reader Mode (September 2025) ✅
**Choice**: Add dedicated reading mode  
**Rationale**: Better reading experience, foundation for MarkdownUI  
**Result**: Clean separation of editing/reading

## Technical Pivots

### Save System Evolution
**August 2024**: No save implementation  
**January 2025**: WriterDocument with save logic  
**September 2025**: Complete with UI and native dialogs ✅

### Toolbar Consolidation
**Original**: Multiple toolbars (Project, Writer, Mapper)  
**January 2025**: Removed MapperToolbar  
**September 2025**: Merged WriterToolbar into ProjectToolbar ✅

### File Browser Journey
**Original**: Three different implementations  
**January 2025**: Still three (confusion)  
**September 2025**: Single FileBrowser.swift ✅

### Navigation Simplification
**Original**: 4+ panels in toolbar  
**January 2025**: 3 panels (removed Mapper)  
**September 2025**: 2 modes (Writer/Reader) ✅

## Current State Analysis (September 2025)

### Stability: GOOD
- Save system complete ✅
- WriterDocument robust ✅
- Auto-save working ✅
- Single file browser ✅
- Unified toolbar ✅

### Completeness: 60-65%
- Save System: 100% complete ✅
- Writer: 75% complete (missing MarkdownUI)
- Reader: 30% complete (foundation only)
- Character: 15% complete (UI only)
- Index: 10% complete (UI only)
- Toolbar: 95% complete (missing undo/redo)
- Statusbar: 100% complete ✅

### Usability: MUCH BETTER
- Can save documents properly ✅
- Clean mode switching ✅
- Font controls accessible ✅
- Information always visible ✅
- Professional feel ✅

## Recovery Plan (Updated September 2025)

### Phase 1: MarkdownUI Integration (1 day)
1. Replace TextEditor in WriterWindow
2. Add to ReaderWindow
3. Configure theme system
4. Test performance

### Phase 2: Core Features (2 days)
1. Implement undo/redo system
2. Character data model & persistence
3. Basic export (PDF/HTML)
4. Connect file browser to open files

### Phase 3: Polish (2 days)
1. Document templates
2. Find/replace functionality
3. Enhanced error handling
4. Accessibility improvements

## Technical Debt Status

### Resolved ✅
```yaml
FIXED:
  - Save UI missing → Complete save system
  - Multiple toolbars → Unified toolbar
  - Three file browsers → Single implementation
  - No statusbar → Full implementation
  - No Reader mode → Foundation complete
```

### Remaining Critical
```yaml
HIGH:
  - No MarkdownUI integration (97 files waiting)
  - No undo/redo system
  - File browser can't open files
```

### Remaining Minor
```yaml
LOW:
  - Character/Index no persistence
  - Timeline directory empty
  - Section title hardcoded
  - No export functionality
```

## Lessons Learned

### From Original Sprint (August 2024)
1. **Focus wins**: Mapper succeeded due to focus
2. **Libraries costly**: MarkdownUI harder to integrate than expected
3. **Vertical slices**: Complete features better than UI shells
4. **Time unrealistic**: 4-6 hours too short for full app

### From January 2025 Split
1. **Separation good**: Focused apps better than monoliths
2. **Document models critical**: WriterDocument essential
3. **Clean as you go**: Should have removed Location/
4. **Strategic assets**: MarkdownUI valuable for future

### From September 2025 Update
1. **Consolidation powerful**: Unified toolbar much cleaner
2. **Save UI critical**: Users need visible save option
3. **Simplification works**: 2 modes better than 4 panels
4. **Information matters**: Statusbar provides confidence
5. **Paper metaphor effective**: Visual hierarchy helps focus
